This is to simulate resolution on pixel modules local coordinates X and Y with tkLayout.
2 modes are avaialble : either resolutionLocalX or Y are set as nominal values, either they are calculated from parameterized models.



* Nominal resolutionLocalX or Y :  
Please specify values for resolutionLocalX or Y in cfg file.
Example : nominalResolutionLocalX 0.010

Please note that if no value nor any parameter is specified in the cfg file, a nominal resolutionLocalX or Y is calculated using the following formulae :
nominalResolutionLocalX = RMS over sensors of (meanWidth / (numStripsAcross * sqrt(12)))
nominalResolutionLocalY = RMS over sensors of (length / (maxSegments * sqrt(12)))



* Parameterized resolutionLocalX or Y :  
Please specify the set of parameters for resolutionLocalX or Y in cfg file.
Please note that as soon as any parameter is specified for a given module type and local coordinate, then the parametric mode is chosen to calculate the corresponding resolution.

Example : @includestd CMS_Phase2/Pixel/Resolutions/Barrel_100x100
Sets of parameters are available for the following module types : 25 um x 100 um, 50 um x 50 um, 50 um x 200 um, 100 um x 100 um.

Initial study was conducted in [1].
Models being now presently used in tkLayout are from [2] and mentioned below.

- Barrel PXB :
Model for resolution on local X coordinate (barrel modules):
resolutionLocalXBarrel = resolutionLocalXBarrelParam0 + resolutionLocalXBarrelParam1 * cotg(alpha) + resolutionLocalXBarrelParam2 * cotg(alpha)^2
Model for resolution on local Y coordinate (barrel modules):
resolutionLocalYBarrel = resolutionLocalYBarrelParam0 + resolutionLocalYBarrelParam1 * exp(-resolutionLocalYBarrelParam2 * abs(cotg(beta))) * sin(resolutionLocalYBarrelParam3 * abs(cotg(beta)) + resolutionLocalYBarrelParam4)

- Endcap PXE :
Model for resolution on local X coordinate (endcap modules):
resolutionLocalXEndcap = resolutionLocalXEndcapParam0 + resolutionLocalXEndcapParam1 * exp(-pow(cotg(alpha), 2.) / resolutionLocalXEndcapParam3) * cos(resolutionLocalXEndcapParam2 * cotg(alpha))
Model for resolution on local Y coordinate (endcap modules):
resolutionLocalYEndcap = resolutionLocalYBarrelParam0 + resolutionLocalYBarrelParam1 * abs(cotg(beta))




NB on geometry :
In the plane of any module, local Y axis is always along the strips, and local X axis is the axis orthogonal to it.
As a result : 
Barrel modules : Local X axis is along RPhi, Local Y axis is along Z.
Endcap modules : Local X axis is along RPhi, Local Y axis is along R.

Specific to parametric case : alpha and beta angles are the reference notation angles for a track hitting a pixel module.
They are defined in Figure 7 from [3].
